# onlyBans

## Edit the Game
The main Twine file here is _only-bans.html_. Import that into the Twine Editor to make changes. 

Most other files are for the website homepage. 

### Note on Media
If you are testing the game from inside the Twine Editor, the relative links for audio, video, etc won' resolve properly. Twine will open the game in-browser from a temp folder each time. A hacky solution is to sync your media files to the same temp location. I wrote a [blog post](https://gramblingsofagal.blogspot.com/2021/03/how-to-display-media-with-relative.html) on this. 

## Run the Game
Open _only-bans.html_ in a browser. Make sure the media directories are in the same folder as that .html file.
